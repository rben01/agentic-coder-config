# Claude Code Configuration

This repository contains configuration files for Claude Code, including statusline
customization and specialized agents. PRs are welcome for interesting and/or useful
agents. MCP servers (of which we currently have none) are also welcome.

Status line currently reads:

```text
cwd | git-branch | v1.x.y (+123|-456)
```

with colors:

```text
blue | cyan/magenta | yellow (green|red)
```

The git branch is cyan when clean, magenta when dirty.
